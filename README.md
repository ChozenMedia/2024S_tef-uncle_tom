## _Uncle Tom_ Lyrics

    I got this uncle named Tom, he cool when he acting black
    I try not to judge him 'cause he ain't from this habitat
    Really be fooling, I school him where he lacking at
    But he don't hear the half of that
    He like to rock a MAGA hat

    Sometimes I question the things that he really seeing
    African American that think he European
    This is America, what part of Europe he in?
    I mean, he say the word nigga so he black when it's convenient
    I peeped it
    He really don't rock with his own kid
    Like he hate Angel Reese and Caitlin is just the bomb
    Like he love Luka Doncic but really don't like LeBron
    But I can't blame him, that's just my Uncle Tom
    Word is bond
    It's politics in every little discussion
    But he do it online, he don't do it out in public
    Always offending people, not knowing what the fuss is
    Overtime Uncle Tom done turned into Uncle Ruckus
    He disrespects Black women, he trynna paint a picture
    It be your own people that'll push that lame agenda
    Always talking 'bout how he could never date a sister
    And his momma Black, but I don't know who raised this nigga
    I realized why he bringing the dark to light
    Disrespect his own people for mentions and all them likes
    How else you think these internet puppets get bought to life?
    I told unc he ain't Black, his new color is Charleston White, get it right

    I don't hate him, he cool when he acting Black
    I try not to judge him 'cause he ain't from this habitat
    Really be fooling, I school him where he lacking at
    But he don't hear the half of that
    He like to rock a MAGA hat
